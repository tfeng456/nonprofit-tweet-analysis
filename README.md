# Nonprofit Tweet Analysis
I created this project for LA Blueprint, a UCLA student organization that produces technology for Southern California nonprofits. As Blueprint works closely with nonprofits, I wanted to create a tool to help members learn about the industry. In order to learn more about the nonprofit industry, we wanted to study social media trends to get the most current information. This project derives insights about the nonprofit industry through the analysis of tweets.
